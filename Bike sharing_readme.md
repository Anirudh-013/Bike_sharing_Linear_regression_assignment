<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## General Information
- A bike sharing service provider company would like to analyze the demand for the shared bikes depanding on some parameters on the day basis. So, a Linear regression model needs to be built from the provided dataset for  prediction of demand & answering the following queries.
    
1.Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?

2.How well those variables describe the bike demand?
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature is a major factor in predicting demand
- Weather situation is a major factor in predicting demand
- Year is a major factor in predicting demand
In detail,Major factors are
•	Temperature (increment in demand)- co efficient = 0.5098
•	Weather situation-Light snow, Light rain…. (Decrement in demand)- co efficient = -0.2488
•	Year (increment in demand)- co efficient = 0.2305
